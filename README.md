# Spelling-Game
Spelling Game that will say a word to you and give you the chance to spell it out

Problem: I was calling the function to generate a random word and a random definition
so I got a different word from defintion so instead I called the function to generate
a random object and stored that as a variable then I called the word value of that object 
and i called the definition value of that object
