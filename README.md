# Spelling-Game
Spelling Game that will say a word to you and give you the chance to spell it out

Problem: I was calling the function to generate a random word and a random definition
so I got a different word from defintion so instead I called the function to generate
a random object and stored that as a variable then I called the word value of that object 
and i called the definition value of that object

the API that I use to generate a word won't fire on page load because it's no longer allowed to work without user activation 
so I have to prompt the user to click the button to hear the word

when adding word to database: add word, definition, difficulty of word

future features:
add the ability to hear words phonetically
so far I havent been able to find any API's that pronounce words phonetically so the only solution in my head is to actually pronounce all of the words myself phonetically and when I add a new word i'll have to add the ability to record myself or someone else pronouncing the word phonetically
